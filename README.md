# Pollito Stuff üê§

Is a page where I challenge myself to built little web apps using a technology stack that I'm not that familiar with, to force me out of the confort zone and keep learning. Also is a cool portfolio

Right now is a simple branch cause I'm the only dev so no need to overengineer the repo
