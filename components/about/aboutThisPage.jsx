          <span className="font-bold">TL;DR:</span> is a page where I challenge
          myself to built little web apps using a technology stack that I'm not
          that familiar with, to force me out of the confort zone and keep
          learning. Also is a cool portfolio

          Previous to get my first web dev job, in a job interview I was given
          the task to build a to-do app, first in plain Javascript, and then
          using React. And oh boy... the React one was a great disaster. I had
          to learn how to decently do state and component management under 48
          hours, including CRUD operations in mongoDB... and it didn't came out
          very well

          It became a place where I develop random ideas I have in my head. Some
          are trivial, some are useful, some are just for fun. But the goal of
          all this is facing challenges that I never had before. I'm someone who
          doesn't like to sit still doing nothing

          Well... idk. I just do whatever I feel like doing at the moment when
